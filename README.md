# loops-in-JS
Loops are used in JavaScript to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. Conditions typically return true or false. A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns false.
for Loop
Syntax
for (initialization; condition; finalExpression) {
  // code
}
The for loop consists of three optional expressions, followed by a code block:

initialization - This expression runs before the execution of the first loop, and is usually used to create a counter.
condition - This expression is checked each time before the loop runs. If it evaluates to true, the statement or code in the loop is executed. If it evaluates to false, the loop stops. And if this expression is omitted, it automatically evaluates to true.
finalExpression - This expression is executed after each iteration of the loop. This is usually used to increment a counter, but can be used to decrement a counter instead.
Any of these three expressions or the the code in the code block can be omitted.

for loops are commonly used to run code a set number of times. Also, you can use break to exit the loop early, before the condition expression evaluates to false.

Examples
1. Iterate through integers from 0-8:

for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Output:
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
2. Use break to exit out of a for loop before condition is false:

for (let i = 1; i < 10; i += 2) {
  if (i === 7) {
    break;
  }
  console.log('Total elephants: ' + i);
}

// Output:
// Total elephants: 1
// Total elephants: 3
// Total elephants: 5
Common Pitfall: Exceeding the Bounds of an Array
When iterating over an array, it's easy to accidentally exceed the bounds of the array.

For example, your loop may try to reference the 4th element of an array with only 3 elements:

const arr = [ 1, 2, 3 ];

for (let i = 0; i <= arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}

// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// undefined
There are two ways to fix this code: set condition to either i < arr.length or i <= arr.length - 1.

for...in Loop
Syntax
for (property in object) {
  // code
}
The for...in loop iterates over the properties of an object. For each property, the code in the code block is executed.

Examples
1. Iterate over the properties of an object and log its name and value to the console:

const capitals = {
  a: "Athens",
  b: "Belgrade",
  c: "Cairo"
};

for (let key in capitals) {
  console.log(key + ": " + capitals[key]);
}

// Output:
// a: Athens
// b: Belgrade
// c: Cairo
Common Pitfall: Unexpected Behavior When Iterating Over an Array
Though you can use a for...in loop to iterate over an array, it's recommended to use a regular for or for...of loop instead.

The for...in loop can iterate over arrays and array-like objects, but it may not always access array indexes in order.

Also, the for...in loop returns all properties and inherited properties for an array or array-like object, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

For example, this simple loop works as expected:

const array = [1, 2, 3];

for (const i in array) {
  console.log(i);
}

// 0
// 1
// 2
But if something like a JS library you're using modifies the Array prototype directly, a for...in loop will iterate over that, too:

const array = [1, 2, 3];

Array.prototype.someMethod = true;

for (const i in array) {
  console.log(i);
}

// 0
// 1
// 2
// someMethod
Though modifying read-only prototypes like Array or Object directly goes against best practices, it could be an issue with some libraries or codebases.

Also, since the for...in is meant for objects, it's much slower with arrays than other loops.

In short, just remember to only use for...in loops to iterate over objects, not arrays.

for...of Loop
Syntax
for (variable of object) {
  // code
}
The for...of loop iterates over the values of many types of iterables, including arrays, and special collection types like Set and Map. For each value in the iterable object, the code in the code block is executed.

Examples
1. Iterate over an array:

const arr = [ "Fred", "Tom", "Bob" ];

for (let i of arr) {
  console.log(i);
}

// Output:
// Fred
// Tom
// Bob
2. Iterate over a Map:

const m = new Map();
m.set(1, "black");
m.set(2, "red");

for (let n of m) {
  console.log(n);
}

// Output:
// [1, black]
// [2, red]
3. Iterate over a Set:

const s = new Set();
s.add(1);
s.add("red");

for (let n of s) {
  console.log(n);
}

// Output:
// 1
// red
while Loop
Syntax
while (condition) {
  // statement
}
The while loop starts by evaluating condition. If condition evaluates to true, the code in the code block gets executed. If condition evaluates to false, the code in the code block is not executed and the loop ends.

Examples:
While a variable is less than 10, log it to the console and increment it by 1:
let i = 1;

while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
do...while loop
Syntax:
do {
  // statement
} while (condition);
The do...while loop is closely related to while loop. In a do...while loop, condition is checked at the end of each iteration of the loop, rather than at the beginning before the loop runs.

This means that code in a do...while loop is guaranteed to run at least once, even if the condition expression already evaluates to true.

Example:
While a variable is less than 10, log it to the console and increment it by 1:
let i = 1;

do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);

// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
// 6
// 7
// 8
// 9
2. Push to an array, even if condition evaluates to true:

const myArray = [];
let i = 10;

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 10);

console.log(myArray);

// Output:
// [10]
